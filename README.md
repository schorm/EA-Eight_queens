# EA-Eight_queens üê∞

To solve the 8 queens problem by the EA algorithm.

## Individual

* In particular we set individual to a 1x8 array, where index and element represent the rows and columns where the queens are respectively

## Fitness

* If there are no other queens on the same row or diagonal where the queen is, add one point

## Mutation

* The simplest random permutation method 

## Crossover

* Cut-and-crossfill crossover

## Parent_selection

* Multi-pointer selection (MPS)

* Tournament

* Random_uniform method


## Survivor_selection

* (mu+ lamda) selection

* Random uniform selection

* Replacement selection method
